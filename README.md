# Analyzing the Pratt School of Information's email listserv using SciKitLearn

The School of Information at Pratt Institute uses a listserv that current students, alumni, and professors can subscribe to for receiving updates and announcements that pertain to the school. The listserv includes messages concerning job postings, class-specific announcements, study recruitment, and general announcements. Much of the email that comes through the listserv does not pertain to all programs, and many students have expressed wanting separate listservs depending on what their interests are. My final project proposal for Machine Learning was to use a model or models to perform text analysis on emails in the School of Information’s listserv in order to detect patterns to classify them into categories. Ideally, this project would also provide a way to automatically sort new email so that it’s only sent to the appropriate students. Python modules like SciKitLearn were used, as well as methods like TF-IDF and N-Grams.
